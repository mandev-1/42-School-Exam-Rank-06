### FD_SET

[<--- back to readme](../README.md)

The `fd_set` is a data structure used in C for managing sets of file descriptors, primarily used with the `select()` function for I/O multiplexing. It's typically defined in the `<sys/select.h>` header, which is often included by `<sys/types.h>`. 

*Here's what you need to know about `fd_set`:*

1. üß† **Purpose**: It's used to keep track of multiple file descriptors (like sockets) that you want to monitor for read, write, or exception conditions.

2. üè† **Structure**: Internally, it's usually implemented as a bit array, where each bit represents a file descriptor.

3. üî¶ **Usage**: You typically create separate `fd_set`s for read, write, and exception conditions.

4. ‚öôÔ∏è **Manipulation**: You don't directly manipulate the `fd_set`. Instead, you use macros to add or remove file descriptors from the set:

   - `FD_ZERO(&set)`: Clears all file descriptors from the set.
   - `FD_SET(fd, &set)`: Adds a file descriptor to the set.
   - `FD_CLR(fd, &set)`: Removes a file descriptor from the set.
   - `FD_ISSET(fd, &set)`: Checks if a file descriptor is in the set.

5. With `select()`: You pass these sets to the `select()` function, which modifies them to indicate which file descriptors are ready for I/O operations.

In your code snippet:

```c
fd_set read_set, write_set, current;
```

This declares three `fd_set` variables:
- `read_set`: Typically used to track file descriptors you want to check for read readiness.
- `write_set`: Used to track file descriptors you want to check for write readiness.
- `current`: Could be used as a temporary set for manipulations.

For your web server, you'd likely use these to manage multiple client connections, checking which sockets are ready for reading (incoming data) or writing (ready to send data).

Remember, when using `select()`, you'll need to reinitialize these sets before each call, as `select()` modifies them.
