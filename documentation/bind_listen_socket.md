```c
    // Bind and listen on the server socket
    if (bind(serverfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, sizeof(serveraddr)) == -1 || listen(serverfd, 100) == -1)
        err(NULL);
```

This line of code handles two critical server setup operations: binding the socket and setting it to listen mode. Let me break it down:

1. **Bind Operation**:
   ```c
   bind(serverfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, sizeof(serveraddr))
   ```
   - `bind()` associates the socket with a specific address and port
   - `serverfd` is the socket file descriptor created earlier
   - `(const struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr` is the server address structure cast to the generic sockaddr type
   - `sizeof(serveraddr)` specifies the size of the address structure

2. **Listen Operation**:
   ```c
   listen(serverfd, 100)
   ```
   - `listen()` marks the socket as passive, meaning it will accept incoming connection requests
   - `serverfd` is the socket to put in listening mode
   - `100` is the backlog parameter, which defines the maximum length of the queue for pending connections

3. **Error Handling**:
   ```c
   if (bind(...) == -1 || listen(...) == -1)
       err(NULL);
   ```
   - Both `bind()` and `listen()` return -1 on failure
   - The if statement uses short-circuit evaluation - if `bind()` fails, `listen()` won't be called
   - On failure of either operation, the `err()` function is called, which likely exits the program with an error message

This code efficiently combines two operations in a single conditional statement. After this code executes successfully, the server socket is bound to the specified address and port and is ready to accept client connections.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
